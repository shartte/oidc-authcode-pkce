# Internet Explorer 11 Support

Supporting Internet Explorer 11 is a hassle, but is possible with a substantial amount of
polyfilling.

The following polyfills are required:

- TextDecoder for decoding base64 encoded UTF-8 strings<br>
  https://github.com/anonyco/FastestSmallestTextEncoderDecoder
- promise-polyfill because crypto.subtle/fetch return a Promise<br>
  https://github.com/taylorhakes/promise-polyfill
- url-search-params-polyfill for building and parsing query strings<br>
  https://github.com/jerrybendy/url-search-params-polyfill
- regenerator-runtime because of heavy async use<br>
  https://github.com/facebook/regenerator/tree/master/packages/regenerator-runtime
- whatwg-fetch for fetch support<br>
  https://github.com/github/fetch

Please ensure that the other polyfills need to be included **before** the `fetch` Polyfill,
since fetch initially will feature-check the Browser and especially the lack of `URLSearchParams`
during this phase will lead to subtle failures.
